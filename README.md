# finlab

Early-stage financial laboratory / sandbox.

## Overview

This repository is currently being initialized. Use it to prototype financial models, backtests, data ingestion scripts, or analytics dashboards. As the codebase grows, expand this README with architecture notes, data sources, and contribution guidelines.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Ryangcastillo/finlab.git
   cd finlab
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a feature branch for changes:

   ```powershell
   git checkout -b feature/initial-setup
   ```

3. Add code / assets, then commit:

   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add initial project files"
   git push -u origin feature/initial-setup
   ```

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) builds the solution(s) (if any) using MSBuild on pushes and pull requests targeting `main`.

## Next Steps

Update this README as functionality is added:

- Project goals & scope
- Tech stack & dependencies
- Folder structure
- Data/source disclaimers
