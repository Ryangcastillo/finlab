# FinLab Application Requirements

## 1. Overview
FinLab is a next-generation shared finance application designed to simplify shared expenses and financial projects for various user groups (couples, families, roommates). It aims to transform financial management into a foundation for stronger relationships by prioritizing trust, automation, and collaborative engagement.

## 2. Core User Pain Points Addressed
- Lack of transparency and communication in shared expenses.
- Difficulty in assigning responsibility for specific bills or expenses.
- Emotional conflicts arising from perceived lack of fairness.
- Inconsistent payments and missed deadlines.

## 3. Key Features (from LandingPage.png and PDF)
- **Shared Expense Tracking**: Easily track and manage shared expenses with clear visibility for all participants.
- **Collaborative Budgeting**: Create and manage budgets together, ensuring everyone stays on the same page.
- **Financial Goal Setting**: Set and track progress towards shared financial goals (e.g., saving for a vacation, down payment).
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Personalized financial guidance, spending pattern analysis, and recommendations (e.g., expense consolidation, shop discounts).
- **Proof Center**: Manage and verify shared expenses with clear proof and communication (from Collabreciept.png).
- **Dashboard**: Overview of upcoming payments, recent activity, and quick access to add expenses (from Dashboard.png).
- **Settings & Permissions**: Manage app configurations and user roles, profile & account, collaborators, template studio, data & privacy (from SettingsPermission.png).

## 4. Technical Considerations & Architecture
- **Data Import**: Support for secure CSV file uploads from banks for transaction data. On-device machine learning models for categorization to ensure privacy and speed.
- **Categorization**: Hybrid approach using rule-based systems and NLP/ML models for accurate and continuously improving expense categorization.
- **Modularity**: The application should be modular to support future scalability and maintainability.
- **Theme**: Adjustable dark and light themes (explicitly requested by user).

## 5. Design Elements & UI/UX (from all image mockups)
- **Consistent Branding**: 


FinLab logo and consistent color palette (green accents, dark/light backgrounds).
- **Layout**: Clean, modern, and intuitive layouts across all pages.
- **Typography**: Clear and readable fonts.
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons, input fields, and navigation elements are clearly distinguishable and user-friendly.
- **Landing Page (LandingPage.png)**: Features section, call to action, clear value proposition.
- **Authentication Page (Authpage.png)**: Simple sign-up/login options with clear calls to action.
- **Dashboard (Dashboard.png)**: Overview of upcoming activities, recent transactions, and quick expense addition.
