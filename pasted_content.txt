Sure thing, Ryan! Visualizing workflow diagrams in the app can greatly enhance user understanding and navigation. Here are some ways to visualize these workflows, along with example templates for each possible workflow or transaction:

### Visualizing Workflow Diagrams

1. **Interactive Flowcharts**: Use interactive flowcharts that users can click through to see the steps involved in each workflow. Each step can have a brief description and visual cues to guide users.

2. **Step-by-Step Guides**: Provide step-by-step guides with visual representations of each step. Use icons, arrows, and short descriptions to make the process clear and easy to follow.

3. **Animated Tutorials**: Create animated tutorials that show the workflows in action. These can be short videos or GIFs that demonstrate how to complete each workflow.

4. **Infographics**: Use infographics to present the workflows in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. Infographics can combine text, icons, and images to convey the information effectively.

5. **Interactive Diagrams**: Implement interactive diagrams where users can hover over or click on different parts of the workflow to get more information. This can be especially useful for complex workflows.
