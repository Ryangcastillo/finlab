### rompt 1: Establishing a Professional Design System & User-Centric Foundation

This initial prompt focuses on creating a cohesive visual style and ensuring that fundamental usability principles are considered from the outset.

"Act as a Senior UI/UX Designer. First, define a comprehensive **design system** for the provided UI. This system should include: a well-balanced **color palette** (specifying primary, secondary, accent, and functional colors), **typography guidelines** (detailing appropriate font families, sizes, and weights for all text elements like main headings, subheadings, body text, and captions), **spacing rules** (ensuring consistent margins, padding, and line heights between elements), and **basic component styling** (e.g., default buttons, input fields, cards). Ensure these choices promote clarity, legibility, and a modern, professional aesthetic [1, 3-8]. Additionally, outline how this design system will facilitate **responsiveness** across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports, focusing on maintaining visual hierarchy and readability on all screens [9-12]. Frame these design decisions with user-centricity in mind, ensuring elements are intuitive and easy to use, aligning with general usability heuristics like 'Visibility of System Status' and 'Match between System and the Real World' [13-18]."

### Prompt 2: Enhancing Interactivity, Consistency & Accessibility

Building on the established foundation, this prompt focuses on adding dynamic feedback, ensuring visual consistency across interactive elements, and addressing core accessibility standards.

"Based on the design system you've just established, now focus on enhancing the **interactivity, consistency, and accessibility** of the UI. Identify all interactive elements (such as buttons, cards, links, and input fields) and propose **subtle microanimations, hover effects, and active states** that provide immediate, clear feedback to the user without being distracting [19-24]. Ensure that all **icons are consistently sourced** from a single, high-quality library to prevent a 'mix and match' look that can undermine professionalism [25-28]. Implement fundamental **accessibility guidelines** (WCAG AA standards) by specifically addressing **color contrast** for all text and interactive elements, ensuring comprehensive **keyboard navigation** for all actionable components (with clear focus indicators), and designing **sufficient touch targets** for mobile interaction (a minimum size of 48x48px with at least 8px spacing) [29-32]. For any forms or input fields, detail how to implement **real-time validation** and **user-friendly error messages** that guide users to correct mistakes proactively [33-36]."

### Prompt 3: Refining Visual Hierarchy, Microcopy & Polish (with an Evaluator Mindset)

This final prompt aims to add a layer of polish, ensure effective communication through text, and encourage the AI to critically evaluate its own work, transforming it from merely functional to truly exceptional.

"With the design system and interactivity enhancements in place, refine the UI for ultimate **visual hierarchy and overall polish**. Critically re-evaluate all elements to ensure **key information is immediately scannable** through the effective use of font sizes, weights, and strategic placement, aligning with **aesthetic and minimalist design principles** that prioritize clarity over clutter [7, 37-39]. Review and refine all **microcopy** throughout the UI (including button labels, instructional text, error messages, and empty states) to be concise, clear, and reflect a consistent, professional brand tone [40-44]. Design comprehensive **loading states** (e.g., skeleton screens, subtle progress bars, engaging custom spinners) and clear **success/error indicators** for all non-instantaneous user actions [23, 45, 46]. Finally, **evaluate the current UI output against all previously defined guidelines** (the comprehensive design system, interactivity enhancements, and accessibility standards). Highlight the top 3-5 areas where further iterative refinement would elevate the design from 'good' to 'exceptional,' providing specific, actionable recommendations for improvement. Aim to identify any remaining generic 'AI-made' characteristics and suggest how to humanize them to create a truly unique and professional feel [42, 47-49]."
